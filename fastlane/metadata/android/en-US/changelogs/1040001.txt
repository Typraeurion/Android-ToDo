Version 1.4.0
* Target Android 12 (Snow Cone)
* Separate the file name and folder in the Export and Import dialogs.
* Added a radio selection to choose between local private storage
  and shared storage; when running on Nougat or later, use the Storage
  Access Framework to have the user select the XML file from the system's
  storage provider rather than have to type in the file location.
* Added a reference to the documentation on the About dialog.
