Version 1.1
* Added support for SDK >= 11 (Honeycomb);
  dropped support for SDK 4-7 (Donut through Eclair)
* Bug fixes for XML import:
  * Update/merge was comparing the item creation time
    rather than the last modification time.
  * When reverting, only overwrite if the item creation time is the same;
    otherwise consider it to be a different item.
  * When updating, only overwrite if the item creating time is the same
    and the modification time is newer; otherwise consider it to be
    a different item.
  * When merging, only overwrite if the item creation time is the same
    (in addition to the update checks); otherwise write a new item.
  * Don’t export the password or private records when the
    “export private” option is un-checked.
* Update an item’s modification time when its due date
  or note changes or is deleted or the item is (un)checked.
* Hide the password field in Settings if a password has not been set.
