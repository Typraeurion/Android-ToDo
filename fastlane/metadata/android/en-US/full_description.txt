<div>A simple and intuitive To Do list based on the app
bundled with Palm Pilot, plus many other features:
<ul>
<li>Entirely offline, requiring few permissions to run.
<ul>
<li>Permission to use external storage is only needed to back up or
restore your lists.  On Marshmallow (Android 6) and later, it is only
requested if you write the file to a public folder.</li>
<li>Permission to run on system boot and to post notifications is only
needed to check for items which are due and that you have set an alarm
for.  On Marshmallow (Android 6) and later, notification permissions
are only requested if you save a To Do item with an alarm.</li>
<li>Permission to vibrate is only needed when notifying you of items
which are due and that you have set an alarm for, if you have “Alarm
vibrate” enabled in the app settings for Nougat (Android 7) or
earlier.  On Oreo (Android 8) and later, alarm vibration and sounds is
managed in the system settings.
</ul></li>
