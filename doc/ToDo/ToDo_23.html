<h1 class="chapter">7 Known Bugs</h1>

<p>The following bugs are known to exist in version 1.3.0 (build date
2025.03.14) of To Do.  If you encounter any other bugs, please go to
my project page on GitHub to report them:
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Typraeurion/Android-ToDo/issues">https://github.com/Typraeurion/Android-ToDo/issues</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is not possible to enter a new item or change the text of an existing
item directly in the To Do list; this can only be done in the item
details form.  I tried making the text in the list editable, but had
difficulty getting it to work.

</li><li>
If you start to create a new item and then press &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;OK&rdquo;, a blank item will be left in the list.

</li><li>
If all categories are shown in the list page and you click &ldquo;New&rdquo;, the
application may or may not crash; normally it should create the item
with a category of &ldquo;Unfiled.&rdquo;  I haven&rsquo;t been able to reproduce this
bug consistently.

</li><li>
It is not possible to delete the last remaining category in the category
list.

</li><li>
When choosing an end date for a repeating task, the &ldquo;End on&rdquo; button
text is not changed to show the chosen date.  (The end date will be
saved when you click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.)

</li><li>
If an end date has been chosen for a repeating task, there is no way to
change it back to &ldquo;no end date.&rdquo;

</li><li>
The number of records that can be imported from a previously exported
file is limited by the amount of memory available to the application.
If you find that the application dies when importing a file, try
splitting the file into two or more smaller files, copying the
&lsquo;<samp>&lt;Metadata&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>&lt;Categories&gt;</samp>&rsquo; sections into each file, and
import them separately.

</li><li>
When importing a backup file, the progress bar may not update properly.
</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 1.2.1 release (built 2025.02.24) but
have been fixed as of 1.2.2 (built 2025.03.06).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Notifications may have been broken for Ice Cream Sandwich.  <em>This
bug was introduced in 2025.02.20 so does not impact earlier versions.</em>

</li><li>
Updating the app settings or the export/import file name may have been
broken for Froyo.  <em>This bug was introduced in 2025.02.20 so does
not impact earlier versions.</em>
</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 2025.02.20 release but have been fixed
as of 2025.02.24.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Exporting any item with a due date that is hidden until some number of
days in advance would result in an invalid XML file which could not be
imported back.  The workaround is to manually edit the XML file and
look for &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp>&lt;hide days-earlier=&quot;</samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; with a line break before the
number; remove the line break (e.g. &ldquo;&lsquo;<samp>&lt;hide
days-earlier=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;</samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;).  <em>This bug was introduced in 2025.02.20
so does not impact earlier versions.</em>

</li><li>
It is not possible to restore the preferences from a previously exported
file.
</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 2017.07.25 release but have been fixed
as of 2025.02.20.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If any item in the list is missing its description, the application
will crash when you try to export the data for a backup.  Attempting
to open the application again will fail.  If this happens, you will
need to close the application and re-start it.  To fix this, select
&ldquo;All&rdquo; categories, show completed items, then search through the list
for the offending item(s) with a blank description and either delete
them or fill in the description.  Then try exporting your data again.
</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 2014.06.02 release but have been fixed as
of 2017.07.25.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Opening the details of any To Do item in landscape orientation would
cause the application to crash.  That was because the application tries
to show or hide the &ldquo;Completed&rdquo; date depending on whether an item was
ever checked, but in landscape mode this field is on the same row as the
&ldquo;Due&rdquo; date.  In the 2017.07.25 release, the &ldquo;Completed&rdquo; field is
always shown even if it has no value.

</li><li>
After an alarm has already gone off, the alarm would go off again every
time a change is made to any To Do item.
</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 2014.04.06 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.06.02.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Honeycomb (Android 3) and newer devices, after viewing the details of
a To Do item or going to the application settings and then returning to
the To Do list, the selected category on the main screen would switch to
&ldquo;All&rdquo;.

</li><li>
How to access the menu may not be apparent on Honeycomb or newer devices
which lack a physical menu button.  The application interface has been
updated so that the menu is now accessible from the title bar.
</li></ul>

<p>In addition to the above bug fixes, a new menu option was added for
conveniently toggling whether to show or hide completed items without
having to enter the application settings screen.
</p>
<p>The following bugs were in the 2014.03.29 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.04.06.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When exporting a backup file the application included private records
regardless of whether &ldquo;Include Private&rdquo; was checked or not.

</li><li>
Importing a backup file in &ldquo;Update&rdquo; mode was checking an item&rsquo;s
creation time rather than its modification time, so a modified item
would never be updated from the file.

</li><li>
When an item as checked complete or the due date changed directly from
the list (as opposed to the item details,) its modification time is not
changed.  As a result, the change is not carried over if you export the
list and then import it to another device in &ldquo;Update&rdquo; mode.

</li></ul>

<p>The following bugs were in the 2014.03.23 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.03.29.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you have not set a password and you try to enter one in the Settings,
the application will crash.  In the 2014.03.29 release, the password
field no longer appears when a password has not been set.

</li></ul>
