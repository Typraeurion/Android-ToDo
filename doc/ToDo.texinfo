@node Device Compatibility, Permissions, The Basics, The Basics
@section Device Compatibility

The application is designed for compatibility with Android 12 (Snow
Cone) but also runs on Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) through 14
(Upside-down Cake) which should cover 98.6% of Android devices on the
market as of March 2025.  (It has been tested on Ice Cream Sandwich,
Marshmallow, Oreo, Quince Tart, and Upside-down Cake.)  Support for
newer Android devices is planned.

@node Permissions, Adding To Do Items, Device Compatibility, The Basics
@section Permissions

When installing the ToDo app or when using certain features, Android
may ask you to grant permission for the app to access some
system-level functions.  The permissions the app requests include:

@itemize @bullet
@item Receive the system ``boot completed'' event.
The app uses this to show notifications for any alarms which may have
come due prior to your device starting up.

@item Foreground service.
This permission was added in Android 10 (Quince Tart).  The app runs a
service to handle alarms for To Do items that are due at a time that
you set.  As of Android 8 (Oreo), this service needs to run in the
foreground in order to post notifications.

@item Post notifications.
The app sends notifications if you set an alarm for any To Do items at
a time you choose on or before the item due date.  Android 12 (Snow
Cone) or lower does not require permission to send app notifications;
on Android 13 (Tiramisu) and above, you need to enable notifications
through the system settings.

In the app notification settings, there will be separate settings for
items whose due date is today or upcoming versus items that are
overdue.  There is also a category for ``Updating Alarms''; this can
be ignored as it is only required by Android for the background
service which posts the other notifications.

@item Vibrating the device.
The app may use this for a haptic notification of an alarm, in
addition to any sound selected in the settings.  Only applies to
Android Nougat and earlier.

@item Write files to external storage.
The app uses this when you export your ToDo data to a file for backup
or transfer.  In Android 6 (Marshmallow) or later, this is only needed
if you select a backup file location outside of the app's private
folder.
@end itemize

@node Adding To Do Items, Changing To Do Items, Permissions, The Basics
@section Adding To Do Items

To add an item to the list, press ``New'', then enter a short
description of the item.

@image{New_item,72mm,84mm}

You can optionally add a priority, which is any positive number, to sort
more important items before less important ones; the highest priority
(first listed) is 1.

You can also add a longer note to the item by pressing the note icon at
the bottom right of the form.  This will bring up a separate page for
entering your notes.  Press ``Done'' when you have finished your notes,
or ``Delete...'' if you no longer need the note.

@image{New_note,72mm,128.1mm}

When finished entering your new item, press ``OK''.

@node Changing To Do Items, Completing Items, Adding To Do Items, The Basics
@section Changing To Do Items

To change an existing item in the list, hold your finger on the item for
a second or so (``long press'') to bring back the item details form.
After making your changes press ``OK'' to save them; or you can press
``Cancel'' to discard your changes, or ``Delete...'' to remove the item
from your list.

@node Completing Items, Changing How Items Are Listed, Changing To Do Items, The Basics
@section Completing Items

On the To Do list, each item has a checkbox next to it.

@image{Simple_list,72mm,66mm}

Tapping this will mark the item as done, but it will not be removed
from the list, so you can always go back to the item and review or
un-check it.

@node Changing How Items Are Listed,  , Completing Items, The Basics
@section Changing How Items Are Listed

From the To Do list, push the Android menu button (the vertical ellipsis
in the top corner on modern Android devices) and then press
``Settings''.  This will let you set different options regarding what is
shown in the list and in what order.

The first item in the settings tells the application in what order your
items are displayed --- by a combination of priority, category (see
@ref{Categorizing Lists},) due date (see @ref{Due Dates and Alarms},)
and alphabetically.  All options will sort items alphabetically where
the other fields are equal.

@image{Sort_options,72mm,128.1mm}

As mentioned in the previous section, items which have been checked off
are not actually removed from the list, but by default they are hidden
from view so you only see the items which haven't been done yet.  If you
turn on ``Show completed and hidden tasks'', then both completed and
incompleted items will be shown.

There is also a dedicated menu option just for toggling whether to show
completed and hidden tasks.  (On Android 3 and newer devices, this
option is shown as a check box on the main application title bar.)

@image{Settings,72mm,90mm}

The next three options will display additional fields next to each
item.  (Items which do not have a due date will show a horizontal dash
when ``Show due dates'' is selected.)

The rest of the settings will be covered in later applicable chapters.

Press the Android back button to close the settings screen.

@node Categorizing Lists, Due Dates and Alarms, The Basics, Top
@chapter Categorizing Lists

Each item can be assigned to a different category, allowing you to
create many unrelated lists --- for example, you can have a list of
things to do, a shopping list, a packing list, books to read, etc.

When the application is first installed it comes with just one category,
``Unfiled,'' and all new items will be in this category.  To add new
categories, open the category drop-down list next to the ``New'' button,
then select ``Edit categories...''.

@image{Default_category_list,72mm,128.1mm}

From the next screen, press ``New'' to make a new line in the category
list, then enter the name of the category right on that page.  Repeat
for every category you want to create.  You can also change previously
entered categories on this page.  When finished, press ``OK'' to save
the new category list, or ``Cancel'' to discard your changes.

@image{Edit_categories,72mm,48mm}

Now when you create a new item, you will have the option of changing the
category it is assigned to.

@image{Custom_category_list,72mm,128.1mm}

On the main list, open the category drop-down and select one of your
custom categories to show only the items in that category.  New items
will default to the currently selected category.  If you select ``All,''
then all items from all categories will be shown.

@image{Single_list,72mm,128.1mm}

@node Due Dates and Alarms, Repeating Tasks, Categorizing Lists, Top
@chapter Due Dates and Alarms

Each item can be given a due date.  From the item detail form, press the
button next to ``Due date'' to bring up a list of the next eight days
(from today until next week.)

@image{Default_due_dates,72mm,128.1mm}

If you need to set a due date more than a week later, press ``Choose
Date...'' which will bring up a calendar view.  From there you can
select the year, month, and day.

@image{Calendar_picker,72mm,128.1mm}

To remove the due date, press the button next to ``Due date'' and then
select ``None'' from the list.

If you have enabled ``Show due dates'' in the application settings
(@pxref{Changing How Items Are Listed}) then you can also set the due
date of an item by pressing the dash or previously set date to the right
of the item.

@image{Listed_due_dates,72mm,72mm}

You can optionally hide an item that has a due date until that date
approaches.  After selecting the due date in the item details form, a
new button will appear labeled ``Hide until.''  Press this button to
bring up another form where you can enable or disable hiding the record,
and specify how many days before the due date to reveal it.

@image{Hide_dialog,72mm,128.1mm}

Hidden records will still be displayed if you have selected ``Show
completed and hidden tasks'' in the application settings.

Items that have a due date may optionally have an alarm as well.  If an
item has a due date in the item details form, a button labeled ``Alarm''
will be available.  Press this to bring up another form where you can
enable or disable the alarm, set how many days before the due date and
what time you want the alarm to go off.  The alarm will sound on the
selected day and every day after that at the same time until the item
has been marked completed.

@image{Alarm_dialog,72mm,128.1mm}

In the application settings, you can choose which sound to use for all
of your To Do alarms.

@node Repeating Tasks, Private Records, Due Dates and Alarms, Top
@chapter Repeating Tasks

Items which have a due date can be made into repeating task.  When a
repeating task is marked as completed, its due date is automatically
moved ahead to the next due date according to the schedule you set, and
the item un-checked again.

@ifnottex
@menu
* Simple Repeats::
* Advance Repeats::
@end menu
@end ifnottex

@node Simple Repeats, Advance Repeats, Repeating Tasks, Repeating Tasks
@section Simple Repeats

Pressing the ``Repeat'' button will bring up a list of several common
types of repeating schedules.  These are:

@image{Default_repeats,72mm,128.1mm}

@itemize @bullet
@item
``Daily until...'' will bring up a calendar where you can select the
final day to repeat the task.  Then every time you complete the task on
or after its current due date, it will advance the due date to the next
day until it reaches the end date.  After that, the task is left in a
completed state.

@item
``Every week'' will advance the due date by one week every time it is
completed.

@item
``Semi-monthly'' will advance the due date by 15 days if the original
due date was on the 1st to the 14th of the month; to the last day of the
month if the original due date was on the 15th; to 15 days earlier in
the @emph{next} month if the original due date was on the 16th to the
29th; or to the 15th of the next month if the original due date was on
the 30th or 31st.  The next time the task is completed, it advances to
the date of the next month that corresponds to the original due date, or
to the end of the month if the next month does not have enough days.

For example: if the original due date is January 30, 2014, then the next
due dates will be February 15, February 28, March 15, March 30, etc.

@item
``Every month'' will advance the due date by one month every time it is
completed, on the same day of the month or at the end of the month if
the next month does not have enough days.

@item
``Every year'' will advance the due date by one year every time it is
completed, on the same day and month of the year.
@end itemize

For all of these options, you can customize the schedule further by
pressing the repeat button again and selecting ``Other...''.

@node Advance Repeats, Private Records, Simple Repeats, Repeating Tasks
@section Advance Repeats

Some schedules aren't as predictable as calendar dates, but To Do gives
you a great deal of additional flexibility in setting up repeating
tasks.  Selecting ``Other...'' from the Repeat list will give you access
to a ``Change Repeat'' form with these options.

The top row of buttons lets you select the unit of time in which
intervals between tasks are measured: days, weeks, months, or years.

For each of the four standard units of time, two more buttons let you
select whether the task repeats at a fixed schedule (for example, paying
bills) or a certain amount of time after the task was last completed
(for example, changing a filter.)

Next, you can enter how many units of time elapse between doing the
task, for example every 2 days or every 7 years.

You can optionally pick a date after which the task no longer repeats.
If you leave this as ``No End Date,'' the task will repeat indefinitely.

Depending on the unit of time and scheduling option chosen, you may have
additional options for further fine-tuning when the task is repeated.
More detail on these is given below.

At the bottom of the form, a text box summarizes how often the task will
repeat given the option you've currently selected.

@ifnottex

@end menu
@end ifnottex

@node Day Options, Week Options, Advance Repeats, Advance Repeats
@subsection Day Options

When advancing a task by days, whether on a fixed schedule or after the
task was last completed, you can choose to make it due only on certain
days of the week --- for example, weekdays, weekends, never on a Sunday,
etc.

@image{Change_repeat-day-after,72mm,128.1mm}

If the next advancement of the due date would put it on a day of the
week that isn't allowed, To Do will normally move the due date forward
to the next allowed day.  You can change this behavior by selecting
``Previous'' to have it move the due date @i{backward} to the previous
allowed day, provided that day still comes after the task's previous due
date.  @i{(The application will never move a due date backward in
time.)}

Selecting the ``Nearest, or:'' button will tell the application to
choose the allowed day nearest the target.  For example if the allowed
days were Monday and Friday and the due date would land on a Tuesday, it
would be pushed back to Monday; while if the due date would land on a
Thursday, it would be pushed forward to Friday.  If the target date is
the same distance from the allowed days, e.g. Wednesday, then the due
date would be chosen according to the ``Previous'' or ``Next'' button.

@node Week Options, Semi Options, Day Options, Advance Repeats
@subsection Week Options

For weekly tasks on a fixed schedule, you can select multiple days of
the week on which the task occurs --- for example, every Tuesday and
Friday.

@image{Change_repeat-week-fixed,72mm,128.1mm}

This gets tricky if your interval is every 2 or more weeks.  In that
case, the due date will advance from one chosen day of the week to the
next within the current week, until it reaches the last chosen day.
After that, it will skip the next week(s) and land on the first chosen
day of the @i{n}th week from where it started.

For tasks that repeat a number of weeks after its last completion, you
can choose to make it due only on certain days of the week just the same
as with daily tasks.  (In this respect, every @math{n} weeks after
completed is identical to every
@ifnothtml
@math{7 @times n}
@end ifnothtml
@ifhtml
@html
7&#x00d7;<i>n</i> 
@end html
@end ifhtml
days after completed.)

@node Semi Options, Month Options, Week Options, Advance Repeats
@subsection Semi Options

Semi-monthly events have two forms: by day of the week or day of the
month.

The first case starts from the day of the week of the initial due date,
and advances every two or three weeks depending on whether there are
four or five of those days in the month.  Normally, the second week
is chosen either two weeks after or two weeks before the initial due
date, depending on whether the first due date is after the second week
of the month.

@image{Change_repeat-semi-day,72mm,128.1mm}

In the event that the initial due date is on the 5th occurrence of a day
of the week, the alternate due date will be on the 2nd week.  For
example, if the first due date is Sunday, March 16, then semi-monthly
repeats would be on the 1st and 3rd Sunday.  On the other hand if the
first due date is Sunday, March 30, then semi-monthly repeats would be
on the 2nd and @i{last} Sunday --- ``last'' being the 4th or 5th,
depending on how many Sundays are in the month.

The second case of semi-monthly events, by date, sets the alternate due
date either 15 days after or 15 days before the initial due date,
depending on whether the first due date is after the 15th day of the
month.  With this form you also have the option to select which days of
the week the due date can fall on, just the same as with daily tasks.

@image{Change_repeat-semi-date,72mm,128.1mm}

@node Month Options, Year Options, Semi Options, Advance Repeats
@subsection Month Options

Monthly tasks can be repeated on a fixed schedule by day of the week,
for example the 4th Monday.  In case the initial due date is on the 5th
occurence of a day of the week, it will be repeated on the @i{last} such
day of the following months.

@image{Change_repeat-month-day,72mm,128.1mm}

Monthly tasks can be also repeated on a fixed schedule by day of the
month based on the initial due date, or a number of months after the
task was last completed.  With these options you can choose to have it
occur only on certain days of the week, in which case the actual due
date will be either the next, previous, or nearest allowed day to the
target day of the month.

@node Year Options, Private Records, Month Options, Advance Repeats
@subsection Year Options

Yearly tasks can be repeated on a fixed schedule by day of the week, for
example the 3rd Monday of February.  This is an ideal option for certain
holidays that always take place on a certain day of the week rather than
a day of the month.

Yearly tasks can be also repeated on a fixed schedule by month and date
based on the initial due date, or a number of years after the task was
last completed.  With these options you can choose to have it occur only
on certain days of the week, in which case the actual due date will be
either the next, previous, or nearest allowed day to the target day.

@node Private Records, Exporting and Importing, Repeating Tasks, Top
@chapter Private Records

Items can be marked as ``Private'', in which case they are normally
hidden in your To Do list unless you turn on ``Show private records'' in
the application settings.

You can add an extra layer of security to your private records by
setting a password from the application's main menu.  After setting a
password, all of your private records will be encrypted and will show up
as ``[Locked]'' in your To Do list and you will not be able to edit them
until you enter your password in the application settings.  When you
exit the application, it forgets your password so that the private
records become locked again the next time anybody opens your To Do list.

@image{Locked_record,72mm,72mm}

@b{Important!  If you have not entered your password in the application
settings and you mark a record as Private, it will @i{not} be
encrypted.}  If you want to encrypt a new record but have not entered
your password yet, simply save it, enter your password in the
application settings, open up your new record and save it again.

You can remove your password and un-encrypt your private records by
choosing ``Set Password'' from the main menu, enter your old password,
but leave the new password blank.

In order to protect against the loss of data on your Android device,
you should periodically make a backup copy.  First, if you have set a
password for your private records make sure you have entered the
password in the ``Settings'' to unlock them.  Then in the main menu
select ``Export Data'' to save all of your To Do items to a file on
your device.

@image{Export-private,72mm,65.1mm}

You can choose where to save the file and what to name it, but by
default it is saved to the app's private storage area on your device.
The export dialog shows the location of this storage, which can vary
depending on your version of Android --- for example:
@file{/sdcard/Android/Data/com.xmission.trevin.android.todo/files/}.

@page

If you select ``Saved to shared storage'', you have the option to save
it anywhere supported by Android's Storage Access Framework if running
Android 7 (Nougat) or newer.  You will need to enter the name of the
export file you wish to save, ending in @file{.xml}.

@image{SAF-Create_Document,72mm,83.5mm}

After pressing ``Save'' you will return to the app's Export screen.

@page

If you are using Android 6 (Marshmallow) or older, selecting ``Save to
shared storage'' will change the folder to the device's default
@file{Downloads} directory.  You can change the location by typing it
in, but be sure the location is accessible.

@image{Export-shared,72mm,88.5mm}

If you wish to include private records in the exported file, be sure
the ``Include Private'' box is checked.  You can also export just the
non-private items by leaving this box unchecked.  When ready, press
``Export''.  The app will show a progress bar as it writes the data
out (if it takes long enough) then return to the To Do list.

@page

@node Importing To Do data, Known Bugs, Exporting To Do data, Exporting and Importing
@section Importing To Do data

When you need to restore To Do items from your backup file, select
``Import Data'' from the main menu and select or enter the location of
the file to import.  If you are importing the data you previously
saved to the app's private storage area, you will need to enter the
same name that you gave the exported file.

@image{Import-private,72mm,95.1mm}

@page

If you are importing data from a file in shared storage, select
``File from shared storage''.  On Android 7 (Nougat) or newer, you can

file with your saved To Do lists.

@image{SAF-Open_Document,72mm,54.9mm}

When you select the document you will return to the app's Import
screen.

@page

If you are using Android 6 (Marshmallow) or older, selecting ``File
from shared storage'' will change the folder to the device's default
@file{Downloads} directory.  You can change the location by typing it
in, but you will need to know in advance where the file is located;
the app doesn't provide a file browser.

@image{Import-shared,72mm,100.2mm}

Next, select the type of import you wish to perform.  The choices are:

@itemize @bullet
@item ``Clean'':
Use this when importing a backup file to a new device, or if you need to
undo all changes which have been made since the file was exported.  This
will erase all of your To Do items and categories before importing
records fom the file.

@item ``Overwrite'':
This option will restore all records from your backup file --- even if
the title has changed --- but leave any new records in the application
alone.

@item ``Update'':
This option will only import records from the backup file whose
modification time is newer than the corresponding record in the
application database.  Use this if you want to keep your To Do list on
multiple devices, to synchronize changes between the two.  Note that if
you update a record on both devices and then try to synchronize them
with an update, the earlier changes will be lost in favor of the later
ones.

@item ``Merge'':
This option will import records from the backup file which have the same
category and title as the corresponding record in the application
database, @i{if} it has a newer modification time, similar to an
Update.  However if the record in the backup file has a different
category or title, or it does not exist in the application database, it
will be added.

@item ``Add'':
This option will add all records from the backup file as new items in
your To Do list, regardless of duplicates.  This should be used if you
created different lists on separate devices and want to copy the list
from one to the other.

@item ``Test'':
This option simply parses the backup file and reads all of its records
without importing any.  Use this if you need to verify the integrity of
your backup file, particularly if you have manually edited it or had it
created by a different application.

@end itemize

@image{Import_activity,72mm,90mm}

If you have set a password for your private records, you do not need to
enter it to back up your private data; the application saves the
encrypted records.  You @i{will} need that password when you need to
import those private records back in to the application.  This may be
different than your current password.  @b{Important!  Do not forget the
password you had when you made the backup file.}  Without thet password,
it will be practically impossible to recover your private records;
however you may still restore all of your non-private records by
un-checking ``Include Private'' on the Import form.

If you have not entered your password in the application settings when
you attempt to import a backup file, the import form will warn you that
any private records imported will not be encrypted.  You may either
cancel the operation to go enter your password and then try again, or go
ahead and import the data and then re-encrypt the private records
later.  To encrypt them afterward, either open up and save each private
record individually, or choose ``Set Password'' from the main menu and
change the password.  @i{(You can change it to the same password if you
wish.)}

item directly in the To Do list; this can only be done in the item
details form.  I tried making the text in the list editable, but had
difficulty getting it to work.

@item
If you start to create a new item and then press ``Cancel'' instead of
``OK'', a blank item will be left in the list.

@item
If all categories are shown in the list page and you click ``New'', the
application may or may not crash; normally it should create the item
with a category of ``Unfiled.''  I haven't been able to reproduce this
bug consistently.

@item
It is not possible to delete the last remaining category in the category
list.

@item
When choosing an end date for a repeating task, the ``End on'' button
text is not changed to show the chosen date.  (The end date will be
saved when you click ``OK''.)

@item
If an end date has been chosen for a repeating task, there is no way to
change it back to ``no end date.''

@item
The number of records that can be imported from a previously exported
file is limited by the amount of memory available to the application.
If you find that the application dies when importing a file, try
splitting the file into two or more smaller files, copying the
@samp{<Metadata>} and @samp{<Categories>} sections into each file, and
import them separately.

@item
When importing a backup file, the progress bar may not update properly.

@item
Exporting any item with a due date that is hidden until some number of
days in advance would result in an invalid XML file which could not be
imported back.  The workaround is to manually edit the XML file and
look for ``@samp{<hide days-earlier="}'' with a line break before the
number; remove the line break (e.g. ``@samp{<hide
days-earlier="3"/>}'').  @emph{This bug was introduced in 2025.02.20

It is not possible to restore the preferences from a previously exported
file.

as of 2025.02.20.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If any item in the list is missing its description, the application
will crash when you try to export the data for a backup.  Attempting
to open the application again will fail.  If this happens, you will
need to close the application and re-start it.  To fix this, select
``All'' categories, show completed items, then search through the list
for the offending item(s) with a blank description and either delete
them or fill in the description.  Then try exporting your data again.

The following bugs were in the 2014.06.02 release but have been fixed as
of 2017.07.25.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Opening the details of any To Do item in landscape orientation would
cause the application to crash.  That was because the application tries
to show or hide the ``Completed'' date depending on whether an item was
ever checked, but in landscape mode this field is on the same row as the
``Due'' date.  In the 2017.07.25 release, the ``Completed'' field is
always shown even if it has no value.

@item
After an alarm has already gone off, the alarm would go off again every
time a change is made to any To Do item.

The following bugs were in the 2014.04.06 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.06.02.

@itemize @bullet
@item
On Honeycomb (Android 3) and newer devices, after viewing the details of
a To Do item or going to the application settings and then returning to
the To Do list, the selected category on the main screen would switch to
``All''.

@item
How to access the menu may not be apparent on Honeycomb or newer devices
which lack a physical menu button.  The application interface has been
updated so that the menu is now accessible from the title bar.
@end itemize

In addition to the above bug fixes, a new menu option was added for
conveniently toggling whether to show or hide completed items without
having to enter the application settings screen.

The following bugs were in the 2014.03.29 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.04.06.

@itemize @bullet
@item
When exporting a backup file the application included private records
regardless of whether ``Include Private'' was checked or not.

@item
Importing a backup file in ``Update'' mode was checking an item's
creation time rather than its modification time, so a modified item
would never be updated from the file.

@item
When an item as checked complete or the due date changed directly from
the list (as opposed to the item details,) its modification time is not
changed.  As a result, the change is not carried over if you export the
list and then import it to another device in ``Update'' mode.

@end itemize

The following bugs were in the 2014.03.23 release but have been fixed as
of 2014.03.29.

@item
If you have not set a password and you try to enter one in the Settings,
the application will crash.  In the 2014.03.29 release, the password
field no longer appears when a password has not been set.
