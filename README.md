# To Do List
for Android

A simple and intuitive To Do list based on the app bundled with Palm
Pilot, plus many other features:

* Entirely offline, requiring few permissions to run.
* Create any number of categories for different lists.
* Set alarms for items that are due or nearly due.
* Configure repeating items which advance their due date when completed.
* Mark items as private and optionally encrypt them with a password.
* Export lists to a local XML file.
* Import lists from either XML or a Palm Pilot data file.
* Backwards compatible with Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and up.

See the [To Do list](doc/ToDo.pdf) documentation for full details on
using the app.
